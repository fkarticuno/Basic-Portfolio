Instructions


Create a new repository in GitHub called Basic-Portfolio.
Clone this repository to your computer using the process we went over in class.
Navigate to the Basic-Portfolio folder that you just cloned onto your machine. Inside this folder, create the following:



3 HTML documents: index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html.
A folder called assets.
Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: css and images.


In the css folder, make a file called style.css.
In the images folder, save the images you plan on using (like your profile image and the placeholder images for the portfolio).
