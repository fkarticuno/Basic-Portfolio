Instructions


Create a new repository in GitHub called Basic-Portfolio.
Clone this repository to your computer using the process we went over in class.
Navigate to the Basic-Portfolio folder that you just cloned onto your machine. Inside this folder, create the following:



3 HTML documents: index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html.
A folder called assets.
Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: css and images.


In the css folder, make a file called style.css.
In the images folder, save the images you plan on using (like your profile image and the placeholder images for the portfolio).





Push the above changes to GitHub.



Make sure to git add . and git commit -m "initial site files". Then type git push origin master to push your changes to your GitHub repo.
